# Sources and licenses

Board display/touch support derives from the FakePod project attachment recorded in docs/HARDWARE.md. Preserve component license files and upstream notices.

Managed components are pinned by dependencies.lock: ESP-IDF v5.5.5, LVGL 8.4.0 and Espressif touch support. Consult each dependency’s included license before redistribution.

Artwork under theme-packs/ was generated with OpenAI image generation for this personal project, inspired by the user’s My Hero Academia and Assassination Classroom request. It is not official franchise artwork. PNG sources have fixed-size RGB565 derivatives for the card; no character artwork is compiled into firmware.

- `main/wifi_policy.h` adapts T-Dongle strongest-network selection with hysteresis, copyright 2026 白一百 baiyibai, MIT; the complete notice is in `licenses/tdongle-MIT.txt`. roon-knob scan/portal patterns informed the independent implementation; no roon-knob source or stored credentials were copied. Exact reference commits are recorded in `docs/WIFI-EXECUTION.md`.

- `vendor/tomlc17.c` and `.h`: CK Tan’s TOML parser, pinned at 8d3766ddafa6515417f4885ae6878ef69fac401e, MIT notice in `licenses/tomlc17-MIT.txt`. Local changes limit bracket/brace nesting to six for bounded ESP32 recursion and cast a uint32_t printf argument to unsigned for Xtensa ABI portability. The obsolete tomlc99 version was inspected and replaced by its successor before implementation.
